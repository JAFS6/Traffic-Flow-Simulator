Traffic Flow Simulator
======================

Traffic Flow Simulator is a PC multiplatform application, although only the Windows version will be generated until it is in an advanced stage of development.
This project was born of the current traffic problem in big cities and the need to improve traffic flow at specific points in urban areas, currently a daily problem.
Traffic Flow Simulator's main objective is to be a useful tool to facilitate the display of traffic simulation based on a logical model, so clearly to evaluate different alternatives to concrete situations, allowing users to recreate these situations by interaction with the tool considering important issues such as congestion of roads or driving behaviors, so that it can improve the flow of traffic on urban roads.
